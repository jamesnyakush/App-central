## Reference
* [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber)  is a lightweight and extensible logging library for Android, developed by Jake Wharton. It wraps Android’s native Log class and provides a cleaner, more flexible API for logging.
* [Catalogs](https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-catalogs)The **Android Build Configuration Catalogs** provide a centralized way to manage dependencies, plugins, and versions in Android projects. Introduced in Gradle 7.0+, catalogs use a libs.versions.toml file to simplify and standardize dependency management across modules.
* [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding)  in Android provides a modern, safer, and more efficient way to interact with XML views in your Kotlin or Java code. Here are the main benefits of using ViewBinding:
* [SharedPreferences](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences) The **Android SharedPreferences** API provides a simple way to store small amounts of key-value data persistently. It’s ideal for saving user preferences, app settings, or flags (like whether onboarding is completed). The data is stored in an XML file and remains available even after the app is closed or the device is restarted. You can access SharedPreferences in either private mode (only accessible by your app) or shared across processes. It’s lightweight, fast, and easy to use, making it perfect for storing simple, non-sensitive data.
