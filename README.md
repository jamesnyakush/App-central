# Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

2. Click on "Get from Version Control".
3. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/jamesnyakush/App-central.git`


## Technologies Used
* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) - are a Kotlin feature that simplifies asynchronous programming by allowing developers to write non-blocking code in a sequential manner. They enable the execution of long-running tasks without blocking the main thread, making it easier to handle concurrency and improve app performance.
* [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/)  - is a lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin applications, including Android. It allows developers to define dependencies in a simple and intuitive way, using Kotlin DSL (Domain Specific Language). Koin is designed to be easy to set up and use, with minimal boilerplate code, making it a popular choice for Android developers who prefer a more straightforward approach to dependency injection compared to other frameworks like Dagger.
* [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) -  is a lightweight and extensible logging library for Android, developed by Jake Wharton. It wraps Android’s native Log class and provides a cleaner, more flexible API for logging.
* [Catalogs](https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-catalogs) - provide a centralized way to manage dependencies, plugins, and versions in Android projects. Introduced in Gradle 7.0+, catalogs use a libs.versions.toml file to simplify and standardize dependency management across modules.
* [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) -  in Android provides a modern, safer, and more efficient way to interact with XML views in your Kotlin or Java code. Here are the main benefits of using ViewBinding:
* [SharedPreferences](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences) - API provides a simple way to store small amounts of key-value data persistently. It’s ideal for saving user preferences, app settings, or flags (like whether onboarding is completed). The data is stored in an XML file and remains available even after the app is closed or the device is restarted. You can access SharedPreferences in either private mode (only accessible by your app) or shared across processes. It’s lightweight, fast, and easy to use, making it perfect for storing simple, non-sensitive data.
